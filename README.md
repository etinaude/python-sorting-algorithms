# python-sorting-algorithms
a series of algorithms in python
please feel free to add and edit

## These have been added:

* Bubble sort
* Counting sort
* Quick sort
* Radix sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Bogo sort

## These will be added:

* Pancake sort
* merge sort
* Pigeonhole sort
* Tim sort
* Heap sort
* Sudo bogo sort

## notes

each algorith is in a function which prints a sorted array (ill change it to return)\
there are notes before each algorithm explaining it

* n = number of elements to sort
* d = number of digits in the largest element
* r = range of elements (largest - smallest)
* k = size of key

the best, average and worst shows the trend of how each algorith will perform when increasing these values.\
I will continue improving this and adding new algorithms
