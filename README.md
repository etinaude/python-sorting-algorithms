# python-sorting-algorithms
a series of algorithms in python
please feel free to add and edit

## These have been added:

* Bubble sort
* Counting sort
* Quick sort
* Radix sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
  
### esoteric sorts:

* Bogo sort

## These will be added:

* Pancake sort
* merge sort
* Pigeonhole sort
* Tim sort
* Heap sort
* LSD radix
* no extra space radix
* bucket sort


### esoteric sorts:

* Sudo bogo sort
* bozo sort
* mirical sort
* sleep sort
* intelegent design sort
* jingle sort
* bogobogo sort
* spagetti sort
* stooge
* rolling stone sort(physics engine required)
* Threating Sort (with deleting a random file each time)
* slow sort
* worst sort
* Linus

## notes

Each algorithm is in a function which takes only an unsorted array as a parameter returns the sorted array\
There are notes before each algorithm explaining it.

* n = number of elements to sort
* d = number of digits in the largest element
* r = range of elements (largest - smallest)
* k = size of key

the best, average and worst shows the trend of how each algorith will perform when increasing these values.\
I will continue improving this and adding new algorithms
