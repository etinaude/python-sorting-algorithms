# python-sorting-algorithms
a series of algorithms in python
please feel free to add and edit

## These have been added:

* Bubble sort
* Counting sort
* Quick sort
* Radix sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* merge sort
* Heap sort
  
### esoteric sorts:

* Bogo sort
* intelligent design sort
* miracle sort/solarbit flip sort
* stalin sort
* Threatening Sort **DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOU USING THIS**

### my own algorithms:

* Sassy sort (tells you to sort it your own damn self)

## These will be added:

* Pancake sort
* Pigeonhole sort
* Tim sort
* LSD radix
* no extra space radix
* bucket sort
* cocktail sort
* sorting network

### esoteric sorts:

* Sudo bogo sort
* bozo sort
* sleep sort
* jingle sort
* bogobogo sort
* spaghetti sort
* stooge
* rolling stone sort(physics engine required)
* slow sort
* worst sort
* Linus

### my own algorithms:

* lls{low level sort} sorts based on -1 to each value and ordering base on which reaches 0 first (only positive ints)
* Reddit sort (post it on Reddit and take the top reply as fact)
* meme sort (sort based on proximity to the numbers 69 and 420)
* combo sort (sorts with 5 algorithms to make sure its correct)
* 5 stages of grief sort

## notes

Each algorithm is in a function which takes only an unsorted array as a parameter returns the sorted array\
There are notes before each algorithm explaining it.

* n = number of elements to sort
* d = number of digits in the largest element
* r = range of elements (largest - smallest)
* k = size of key

the best, average and worst shows the trend of how each algorithm will perform when increasing these values.\
I will continue improving this and adding new algorithms
